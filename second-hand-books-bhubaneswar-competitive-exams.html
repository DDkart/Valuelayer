    <strong>Walked the entire market on February 17, 2026:</strong> If you're preparing for UPSC, OPSC, SSC CGL, Railways, NEET, JEE, or banking exams in Bhubaneswar, buying every book new will drain your budget faster than you'd expect. A single Laxmikant for Polity is ₹650 at MRP. An M. Lakshmikant + Spectrum Modern History + Bipin Chandra combination can cost ₹1,800–2,000 new. The same set in readable second-hand condition? ₹600–900, if you know where to look. The good news: BBSR has a well-developed second-hand book ecosystem, concentrated along the <strong>Janpath corridor</strong> from Unit-1 down through Master Canteen to the Ram Mandir Vending Zone. I've walked the entire length and covered the side pockets — here's exactly where to go.

  <h2>Why Second-Hand Books Make Sense for Competitive Exam Prep</h2>

  <p>The savings are not marginal — they're significant. For a full UPSC preparation bibliography, buying second-hand from the right sources can save ₹4,000–8,000 compared to buying new. NEET aspirants who pick up used coaching modules at CRP Square can save ₹2,000–4,000 over the retail price of the same sets.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="pro-tip">
    <strong>💡 The single biggest risk in buying second-hand competitive books:</strong> getting a book from the wrong syllabus year. UPSC changed its syllabus significantly in 2013. OPSC and SSC syllabuses update periodically. Always check the edition and compare against the current official syllabus notification before paying.
  </div>

  <!-- ─── 1. UNIT-1 ─────────────────────────────────────────── -->
  <h2 id="unit1">1. Unit-1 Haat &amp; Capital Daily Market</h2>

  <div class="quick-ref">
    <div class="quick-card">
      <h4>📍 How to Get There</h4>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Where</td><td>Inside Unit-1 Haat complex, Bapuji Nagar. Book stalls are on the <em>inner lanes</em> — not visible from the main road</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Auto drop</td><td>Ask for "Unit-1 Market Building" or "Unit-1 petrol pump". Walk in past the vegetable sellers</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Key shop</td><td>Capital Book Depot, Shop CV-35, Capital Daily Market (near Kalinga Complex side)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Hours</td><td>Tue–Sat 8 AM–9 PM; Sun 9 AM–9:30 PM; Closed Monday</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <div class="quick-card">
      <h4>💰 What's Available &amp; Prices</h4>
      <table>
        <tr><td>PY Question Papers</td><td>₹30–80 (vs ₹150–200 in shops)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>SSC / Railway guides</td><td>₹80–200 used</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Odia-medium books</td><td>₹60–180</td></tr>
        <tr><td>OPSC/OAS booklets</td><td>₹80–200</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The Capital Daily Market — locally called the <em>"capital market area"</em> — sits adjacent to the main Unit-1 Haat building. The book section is not visible from the road. Walk in past the sabji sellers and follow the inner lane. Capital Book Depot at Shop CV-35 is the anchor here, stocking competitive exam books in Odia, Hindi, and English — SSC, Railways, Banking, OPSC, OSSC, and state-level exams.</p>

  <p>Several smaller stalls surround it in the same cluster — these are the ones worth spending time at. Previous year question papers are almost always available at ₹30–80 a piece, compared to ₹150–200 in a proper bookshop. The stall owners know the local exam calendar better than most: if OSSC or OPSC prelims are coming up, they stock accordingly.</p>

  <div class="pro-tip">
    <strong>💡 Unit-1 Insider:</strong> If you ask specifically for exam-relevant titles, stall owners often pull things from under the counter that aren't on display. This market is best for SSC, Railways, Banking, and Odia-medium OPSC materials. UPSC range is thinner here — go to Master Canteen for that.
  </div>

  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> SSC CGL / GD, Railways GK, Banking / IBPS, OSSC state exams, OPSC preliminary booklets in Odia. Not the strongest for full UPSC preparation.</p>

  <!-- ─── 2. MASTER CANTEEN ──────────────────────────────────── -->
  <h2 id="master-canteen">2. Master Canteen — Behind Tarini Temple (Best for UPSC/OPSC)</h2>

  <div class="quick-ref">
    <div class="quick-card">
      <h4>📍 How to Get There</h4>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Where</td><td>Janpath Road, Unit-3, near Tarini Temple behind Master Canteen square. Walk past the temple — bookshops on the left</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Auto drop</td><td>"Janpath, Master Canteen side" — every auto driver knows this</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Stalls</td><td>8+ permanent second-hand bookshops within 100 metres</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Best time</td><td>Saturday / Sunday morning (less crowded); Weekday 5–7 PM is peak and congested</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <div class="quick-card">
      <h4>💰 What's Available &amp; Prices</h4>
      <table>
        <tr><td>NCERTs (Class 6–12 each)</td><td>₹20–60 used</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Laxmikant / Spectrum used</td><td>₹150–300 depending on edition</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Coaching module sets</td><td>₹200–600 per subject</td></tr>
        <tr><td>OPSC PY Q-papers (bound)</td><td>₹80–150</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This is the most-recommended second-hand book market in BBSR and has been for at least two decades. There are at least eight permanent second-hand bookshops here, plus a few stalls that appear on busy mornings. One shopkeeper — Ranjan, who runs a store with his brother — has been in this business since the early 2000s. He buys old books from students who've cleared their exams and resells at 30–40% below MRP.</p>

  <p>This cluster is the right place if you're doing <strong>UPSC Civil Services or OPSC OAS</strong> preparation. Standard titles are almost always in stock: Laxmikant, Spectrum, Bipin Chandra, India Year Book, Geography by Majid Husain, Economy by Ramesh Singh. You won't find every edition but you'll find most of them. The full NCERT set (Class 6–12, all subjects) is typically available for ₹600–800 — versus ₹2,400+ new.</p>

  <div class="verdict">
    <div class="v-tag">⭐ ValueLayer First Stop Recommendation</div>
    <p><strong>Padmalaya Medical &amp; General Books</strong> on Janpath Road (Plot 31/A, near the Giri Durga Temple junction, Kharvela Nagar) is the best-stocked proper shop in this stretch. The range of a large bookshop, up to 25% discount on new books, and decades of operating history. Open all days including Sunday, 10 AM–10 PM. If you're new to BBSR and unsure where to start — come here first.</p>
  </div>

  <p>A few stalls further down the Janpath toward the Ram Mandir side stock second-hand novels and used guides. The Ram Mandir Vending Zone (Shop No. 66, Janpath) has a dedicated second-hand book dealer who handles competitive titles alongside college-level books.</p>

  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Full UPSC and OPSC preparation sets. NCERTs (best selection and lowest prices in the city). Coaching materials from Aakash and Allen (used). Odia literature and general knowledge books.</p>

The standard Laxmikant + Spectrum + Bipin Chandra UPSC combo — available for ₹600–900 at Master Canteen — would cost ₹1,650+ bought new. Prices verified at Unit-1 Haat, Master Canteen, and CRP Square stalls on February 17, 2026.</figcaption>

        <tr><td>NCERTs</td><td>Available — good range</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The Old Book Store in Kharvela Nagar is a permanent shop — not a pavement stall — and it runs unusually long hours: open till 10 PM every day. That matters significantly if you're working during the day and can only visit in the evening.</p>

  <p>Reviewers consistently mention it for competitive exam books specifically: <em>"You can find different books with adequate price — materials, textbooks, guidebooks, NCERTs and so on."</em> The selection covers both academic and competitive categories. You can also sell your old books here, though not all coaching-specific titles are accepted — call ahead if you're trying to offload specific modules.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere is notably library-like — quiet and organised for a second-hand store. One student reviewer mentioned spending seven productive hours there simply reading through material before deciding what to buy. That kind of unhurried browsing latitude is uncommon in a commercial bookshop setting.</p>

  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Evening and late-night visits. Students who want to browse at length before buying. OSSC and state-level exam books in Odia.</p>

  <!-- ─── 4. CRP SQUARE ──────────────────────────────────────── -->
  <h2 id="crp-square">4. Old Book Stores — CRP Square, Nayapalli (Best for NEET/JEE)</h2>

        <tr><td>Google Rating</td><td>⭐ 4.2 / 5  (203+ reviews)</td></tr>

        <tr><td>HC Verma Vol 1+2 used</td><td>₹170–230</td></tr>
        <tr><td>DC Pandey / RD Sharma used</td><td>₹160–280</td></tr>
        <tr><td>CBSE board prep guides</td><td>₹80–200</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>If you're preparing for engineering entrance (JEE, OJEE) or medical entrance (NEET, AIIMS), the better second-hand supply is at CRP Square — not Unit-1. This cluster is a congregation of several shops near the BRIT Colony area, and reviewers specifically mention finding used coaching institute materials here: Aakash, Allen, FIITJEE modules, as well as standard Class 12 and graduation-level science books.</p>

  <p>For standard titles like HC Verma, DC Pandey, Morrison Boyd, and RD Sharma, the savings over new copies are usually meaningful. One important note from reviewers: coaching materials here can sometimes be priced higher than what you'd find on Flipkart or Amazon — so check the online price before paying. This applies especially to popular Aakash module sets.</p>

  <div class="verdict">
    <div class="v-tag">👤 Seema Book Store — Owner Praised by Name</div>
    <p><strong>Seema Book Store</strong> near Stewart School, CRP Square, is worth a specific mention. Multiple reviewers describe the owner as <em>"the most humble person"</em> and <em>"polite and kind-hearted"</em> — consistently praised for being helpful and not overcharging. For anyone who's dealt with aggressive bookshop counter staff, that track record matters. Competitive books stocked at student-friendly prices.</p>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> NEET/JEE coaching materials (Aakash/Allen/FIITJEE used modules), HC Verma, DC Pandey, Biology by Trueman, Engineering Drawing, Class 12 science board prep. Also a good source for +3 science textbooks for NISER/CUET aspirants.</p>

Padmalaya Books (Plot 31/A) is the best-stocked single shop on this entire stretch, offering up to 25% discount on new books and a wide range of second-hand titles. Best visited Saturday or Sunday morning before the evening congestion builds near the temple junction.</figcaption>

        <tr><td>Pricing caution</td><td>Negotiate — some books priced above MRP</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Worth knowing about specifically for <strong>UPSC and OPSC Civil Services</strong> aspirants. The Old Bus Stand area near AG Square has a cluster of bookstores that have been catering to competitive exam students for decades. A.N. Book Store is considered the best of the lot for civil services preparation — it stocks Yojana and Kurukshetra magazines, NCERT compilations, and UPSC-specific titles you don't commonly find in general bookshops across the city.</p>

  <div class="tips-box">
    <h3>⚠️ Honest Warning — AG Square Pricing</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Prices can be marked up without an MRP label.</strong> One reviewer flagged that a book quoted at ₹300 was being sold for ₹600 without any printed price reference. Come with reference prices already in your head.</li>
      <li><strong>The owner can be difficult about exchanges.</strong> If you're buying, be certain. Returns are not a standard practice here.</li>
      <li><strong>Negotiate firmly.</strong> Unlike the friendlier market at Master Canteen, this cluster requires a more assertive approach. If the price seems wrong, say so and be prepared to walk.</li>
      <li><strong>The wider complex is useful.</strong> Stores around A.N. Book Store in the same Old Bus Stand complex stock Odia-medium competitive guides and GK compilations that are harder to find at Master Canteen.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> UPSC Civil Services aspirants who want Yojana/Kurukshetra back issues, rare UPSC-specific titles, and Odia-medium GK compilations. Go with a price reference and a willingness to negotiate.</p>

  <!-- ─── 6. KALPANA ─────────────────────────────────────────── -->
  <h2 id="kalpana">6. Kalpana Square &amp; Tankapani Road Footpath Stalls</h2>

  <div class="quick-ref">
    <div class="quick-card">
      <h4>📍 Location</h4>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Where</td><td>Footpath stalls near Kalpana Square, and along Tankapani Road toward Kalpana</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Confirmed address</td><td>Plot No. 40, Tankapani Road, Kalpana — second-hand book dealer (sale and purchase)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Format</td><td>Informal — pavement sellers on tarpaulins and plastic sheets</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Best time</td><td>Weekday mornings and weekend afternoons</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <div class="quick-card">
      <h4>💰 What to Expect</h4>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Price potential</td><td>20–30% of cover price on a good day</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Reliability</td><td>Stock rotates constantly — no guarantees</td></tr>
        <tr><td>No</td><td>Fixed address / phone number / guaranteed stock</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Strategy</td><td>Browse patiently — occasional finds not available elsewhere</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>These are the most informal spots on this list — pavement sellers who spread their stock on tarpaulins or plastic sheets, mostly on weekday mornings and weekend afternoons. The selection rotates constantly because it's built from whatever students sell after their exams. On a good day you can find absolutely current-edition books for 20–30% of their cover price. On a slow day the stalls might have only outdated syllabus editions.</p>

  <p>No fixed address, no phone number, no guaranteed stock. You have to walk past, crouch down, and check what's there. But if you're patient and lucky, the Kalpana Square footpath strip can yield finds that no proper bookshop would offer at that price. It's worth combining with a visit to the Old Book Store at Kharvela Nagar in the same trip — both are on the same auto route from the city centre.</p>

  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Opportunistic browsing on a patient afternoon. Not reliable for a specific title you urgently need, but potentially the cheapest source in the city for whatever it happens to have on a given day.</p>

  <h2 id="tips">Bargaining, Selling, and a Few Honest Notes</h2>

  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">1</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>You can bargain at almost every stall.</strong> Pavement sellers and smaller shops are usually flexible, especially if you're buying multiple books in one go. Buying five or six books? Expect 10–20% off the quoted price if you ask. Padmalaya and A.N. Book Store are less flexible but not rigid.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">2</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>You can also sell your old books.</strong> Most dealers will buy from you — typically 10–25% of cover price, sometimes higher for in-demand exam-specific titles. If you've finished a batch of OPSC preparation books, selling them before buying the next set helps offset costs significantly.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">3</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>Watch for outdated editions.</strong> UPSC syllabus changed significantly in 2013. OPSC and SSC syllabuses update periodically. Always check the edition and compare it against the current official syllabus notification before paying — ask the seller which year the book covers if you're unsure.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">4</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>Coaching module quality varies.</strong> Used Aakash and Allen modules are available at multiple locations. Their value depends entirely on whether the notes and markings inside are clean or chaotic. Always flip through before you pay. Heavily annotated books slow down your reading and can embed someone else's misunderstandings into your study.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">5</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>The Master Canteen cluster is your best first stop.</strong> If you're new to BBSR and don't know where to start, take an auto to <em>"Janpath, Master Canteen side"</em> and walk the lane behind the Tarini Temple. You'll find eight or more shops within a hundred metres and get a feel for the market, the prices, and what's available in one visit.</div>
    </li>
