    <strong>Visited in person, February 17, 2026:</strong> Getting a driving license in Bhubaneswar sounds simple until you're in the middle of it. Learner's license test, RTO slot booking, documentation, road test — and somewhere in between you're supposed to learn to drive without panicking at Vani Vihar crossroads or stalling at Kalpana Square signal. The right driving school doesn't just teach you to operate a car — it walks you through the entire license process. I visited seven schools across BBSR, from the IRC Village side to Chandrasekharpur, to find out which ones actually deliver on both.

  <!-- ─── FEE OVERVIEW ─────────────────────────────────────── -->
  <h2 id="fees-note">A Quick Note on Fees Before You Read Further</h2>

  <p>Most private driving schools in Bhubaneswar charge between <strong>₹3,500 and ₹6,000 for a 15-day car course</strong>. The fee usually includes daily 30-minute sessions, basic traffic rule instruction, and help with your learner's license slot at the Odisha RTO. A permanent driving license (DL) has its own government fees — separate from the school's charges — paid directly to the RTO.</p>

  <div class="price-grid">
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Typical 15-day private course</span><span class="value">₹3,500 – ₹6,000</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Learner's License (LL) — Govt fee</span><span class="value">~₹200 (STA Odisha portal)</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Permanent DL — Govt fee (LMV)</span><span class="value">₹773 – ₹1,073</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Govt fee paid to</span><span class="value">RTO directly — not the school</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Online portal</span><span class="value">sta.odisha.gov.in / parivahan.gov.in</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Government DTS (free option)</span><span class="value">Only Govt DL fees payable</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class="pro-tip">
    <strong>💡 Before You Pay Anything:</strong> Ask the school exactly what "license assistance" covers — does it mean they fill your form, or do they book your RTO slot and follow up on documents? These are very different levels of service. The answer will tell you a lot about the school.
  </div>

  <!-- ─── 1. GAJAPATI ─────────────────────────────────────── -->
  <h2 id="gajapati">1. Gajapati Driving School — Jayadev Vihar, Nayapalli</h2>

      <h4>💰 Pricing</h4>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Course fees (15-day)</td><td>~₹4,000 – ₹5,500</td></tr>
        <tr><td>License assistance</td><td>Yes — LL &amp; DL paperwork</td></tr>

        <tr><td>Early morning slots</td><td>Available from 6 AM</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The most-reviewed driving school on this list — and it holds a perfect 5.0 average. That combination almost never happens. Usually the places with 1,000+ reviews settle around 4.3 or 4.4. Gajapati has held its 5.0 through more than a thousand ratings, which speaks to extraordinary consistency.</p>

  <p>I spoke with two students outside the school on Jayadev Vihar road — one on her third session, one who had just collected his permanent DL. Both mentioned the same instructor: <strong>Mr. Somnath Sahoo</strong>. His approach is step-by-step: basic controls first, then local roads, then main arteries. Reviewers note he never raises his voice even when a student stalls near the Nayapalli Housing Board Colony stretch — which, if you've driven there, you'll appreciate.</p>

  <p><strong>Teaching style:</strong> Patient, structured, beginner-focused. Emphasis on building confidence over speed. &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Best for:</strong> Complete beginners who want to learn properly before attempting the RTO test.</p>

  <!-- ─── 2. GAJANAN ─────────────────────────────────────── -->
  <h2 id="gajanan">2. Gajanan Driving Training Institute — IRC Village, Nayapalli</h2>

  <div class="quick-ref">
    <div class="quick-card">

      <table>

        <tr><td>License assistance</td><td>Yes — full RTO support</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Notable instructors</td><td>Suresh Sir, Sumanta Sir, Rishi Sir</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Course duration</td><td>21 days (longer than standard)</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Over 1,100 reviews, all pointing to the same result: this place produces confident drivers. The primary course here is <strong>21 days</strong> — slightly longer than the industry-standard 15 — which reviewers consistently say makes a real difference. You spend the first week on the quieter lanes around the IRC Village–Niladri Vihar stretch before moving to the busier roads near the Kalpana Square side.</p>

  <p>Multiple instructors are mentioned by name across reviews — Suresh Sir, Rishi Sir, Sumanta Sir — all described as patient and clear. One reviewer mentioned being a complete beginner who had never even ridden a bicycle, and was driving solo on a main road by Day 5 under Sumanta Sir's guidance. Gajanan also handles RTO documentation as part of its service — learner's license application, DL slot booking, form preparation. You don't need to navigate the STA Odisha portal on your own.</p>

  <p><strong>Teaching style:</strong> Gradual road progression, multiple experienced instructors, 21-day structure gives more practice time than most. &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Best for:</strong> Anyone who wants extra time to build confidence before the license test.</p>

    <figcaption>The two-stage license process in Odisha: first the Learner's Licence (valid 6 months, applied via sta.odisha.gov.in), then the Permanent DL after 30 days — with a road test at the Nayapalli RTO. Every school on this list helps with both stages; what varies is how much they do for you vs. what you handle yourself.</figcaption>

  <!-- ─── 3. DREAM ─────────────────────────────────────── -->
  <h2 id="dream">3. Dream Driving School — Bomikhal, Rasulgarh</h2>

  <div class="quick-ref">
    <div class="quick-card">
      <h4>📍 Location &amp; Hours</h4>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Address</td><td>Plot 242/1731, near Girnar Palace, Dayanandnagar, Bomikhal, Rasulgarh</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Hours</td><td>Open 24 hours, 7 days a week</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Phone</td><td>Available on Google Maps</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Google Rating</td><td>⭐ 4.9 / 5  (786+ reviews)</td></tr>

        <tr><td>License assistance</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Notable instructor</td><td>Sashikant Sir (Shashikanta)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Price tier</td><td>Among lowest in BBSR</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>If you live anywhere on the Rasulgarh–Bomikhal–Saheed Nagar belt, Dream Driving School is the most convenient option on this list. Tucked off the Dayanandnagar side of Rasulgarh, near Girnar Palace — easy to reach from the Rasulgarh big bazaar on foot or by two-wheeler.</p>

  <p>Nearly every review mentions one name: <strong>Sashikant Sir</strong>. He's the rare instructor who explains <em>why</em> you do things, not just what to do — breaking down gear shifting, clutch feel, and distance judgment in ways that make intuitive sense. One person wrote that he made busy Bhubaneswar traffic feel manageable, which is a significant claim given the chaos around the Rasulgarh square during peak hours. Fees are among the lower end of what private schools charge in BBSR.</p>

  <p><strong>Teaching style:</strong> Conceptual and calm — understanding the car, not just operating it. &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Best for:</strong> Residents of the Rasulgarh–Bomikhal–Saheed Nagar corridor who want quality training at competitive prices.</p>

  <!-- ─── 4. SOMSAI ─────────────────────────────────────── -->
  <h2 id="somsai">4. SOMSAI Driving Training School — Aurobindo Market, Chandrasekharpur</h2>

  <div class="quick-ref">
    <div class="quick-card">
      <h4>📍 Location &amp; Hours</h4>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Address</td><td>Plot 333, Aurobindo Market Complex, Nandankanan Road, near Aditya Ashwini Hospital, Damana, CSP</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Hours</td><td>Mon–Sun, 6:00 AM – 9:00 PM</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Phone</td><td>Available on Google Maps</td></tr>

        <tr><td>License assistance</td><td>Yes — proactive document reminders</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Notable instructors</td><td>Gopal Panda Sir, Amiya Sir, Shibu Bhai</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Early morning</td><td>From 6 AM for working professionals</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The go-to school for people living in the Chandrasekharpur–Patia–Damana pocket of BBSR. The location near Aditya Ashwini Hospital on the Nandankanan Road is a landmark most people in that part of the city know well — auto drivers can drop you there without direction. SOMSAI runs 15-day courses with a clear structure: first few days on rules and basics, then local roads, then busier stretches.</p>

  <p>Instructors Gopal Panda Sir, Amiya Sir, and Shibu Bhai are all mentioned multiple times in reviews. The school's RTO assistance covers both LL and permanent DL slot booking, and the team is reportedly proactive about reminding you of document deadlines — something several other schools leave entirely to the student.</p>

  <p><strong>Teaching style:</strong> Structured 15-day programme, real-road exposure from Day 3, strong emphasis on traffic rules and road safety. &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Best for:</strong> Residents of the Chandrasekharpur–Damana–Infocity area. Early 6 AM slots available.</p>

  <!-- ─── 5. A-ONE ─────────────────────────────────────── -->
  <h2 id="aone">5. A-ONE Driving Training School — Unit 8, Surya Nagar</h2>

        <tr><td>Own-car practice</td><td>Allowed — unusual and useful</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A second school on this list with a perfect 5.0, and with 646 reviews that's a meaningful sample. A-ONE is in Unit 8, Surya Nagar — a quieter residential part of BBSR on the south side, near the Lingaraj Temple area. If you're coming from Unit 1, Unit 2, or the Old Town side, this is the closest well-rated school on this entire list.</p>

  <p><strong>Bitu Sir</strong>, <strong>Bapi Sir</strong>, and <strong>Lokanath Bhai</strong> dominate the reviews — each described as patient, friendly, and practical. Bitu Sir is mentioned in a dozen reviews with what one student called "unconditional patience with even the most anxious beginners." The school also lets you practice in your own car if you prefer — which is unusual and genuinely useful if you own a vehicle but never learned to drive it.</p>

  <p><strong>Teaching style:</strong> Personalised and adaptable — sessions tailored to your anxiety level and learning pace. &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Best for:</strong> People on the southern side of BBSR — Unit 1, Unit 2, Old Town, Lingaraj area.</p>

    <figcaption>The Regional Transport Office at Nayapalli is where all Bhubaneswar driving license road tests take place. Several schools on this list — including Gajapati, Gajanan, and A-ONE — specifically take students on the RTO road test route before test day.

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Driveasy is slightly off the main road — behind the Bank of Baroda on the Jharapada Canal Road — but reviews suggest people find them worth the detour. Instructors <strong>Nimai Sir</strong>, <strong>Bablu Bhai</strong>, and <strong>Karunakar Sir</strong> are all mentioned repeatedly, with Nimai Sir credited for particular patience with students who have never touched a four-wheeler before.</p>

  <div class="verdict">
    <div class="v-tag">🏆 Best Full DL Service</div>
    <p>Driveasy's standout feature is its <strong>end-to-end license processing</strong> — they handle the application from start to finish if you need them to, which matters for people who find the STA Odisha portal confusing or can't easily take time off for RTO visits. One reviewer specifically chose Driveasy <em>because</em> of the DL processing service, not the driving lessons.</p>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Teaching style:</strong> Practical and car-focused. Bablu Bhai is noted for teaching students about their vehicle, not just the road. &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Best for:</strong> People who want full license processing handled along with training, without running around the RTO on their own.</p>

      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Two branches covering two very different parts of the city. The Saheed Nagar branch at Unit 3, Kharvela Nagar is useful if you're near the central government office cluster or coming from the Vani Vihar direction. The Chandrasekharpur branch on CS Pur Road serves the Housing Board Colony side.</p>

  <p>The school's notable strength is flexibility — multiple reviewers mentioned getting lessons in their <em>own car</em>, which the instructors agreed to without hesitation. One person returned to this school specifically after failing to build confidence elsewhere, and said it was the first place where the instructor adjusted the teaching to what the student actually needed. <strong>Mirza Sir</strong> and <strong>Shail Sir</strong> are the two most frequently mentioned. One review described Shail Sir as "a good human being" before anything else — which, for someone sitting beside you while you navigate BBSR traffic, is the most important qualification.</p>

  <p><strong>Teaching style:</strong> Flexible and student-led. Lessons in your own car available. Practical approach, minimal theory padding. &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Best for:</strong> People who already know basics but need to build road confidence, or want to practice in their own vehicle.</p>

  <p>This is the most underrated option in BBSR and almost nobody mentions it in standard "best driving school" lists.

It's not glamorous — the building is old and seats fill up through annual newspaper advertisements — but the training is thorough: simulator training before you ever sit in a real car, then full practical road sessions.</p>

  <div class="tips-box">
    <h3>⚠️ Government DTS — Key Caveats</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Admission happens once a year</strong> through a competitive selection process announced in local Odia newspapers. The waiting period can be long.</li>
      <li><strong>Not for people in a hurry.</strong> If you need a DL in the next 2–3 months, choose a private school. If you have time, this is genuinely the best value in BBSR.</li>
      <li><strong>You still pay Govt RTO fees</strong> (₹773–₹1,073) at the end — the school itself is free.</li>
      <li><strong>Eligibility check first.</strong> Age 18–35, Odisha resident, minimum height 5 feet. Confirm current eligibility criteria before applying as these may have been revised.</li>
    </ol>

  <h2 id="tips">What I'd Tell a First-Timer in BBSR</h2>

  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">1</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>Ask specifically about license assistance before you pay.</strong> Most schools include it, but "include" can mean anything from "we'll fill your form" to "we'll book your RTO slot and follow up on documents." These are very different levels of service. The answer tells you a lot about the school.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">2</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>The 15-day course is standard, but 21 days is better if you're a complete beginner.</strong> Half an hour per day for 15 days is 7.5 hours behind the wheel — workable but thin if you've never driven. Gajanan's 21-day structure gives you 3 more hours of practice, which matters on Bhubaneswar's roads.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">3</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>Practise in your own car if you own one.</strong> Several schools here allow this. The school's training vehicle has dual controls — the instructor can brake from the passenger side. Your car doesn't. Learning to trust yourself in your own vehicle before the DL test is worth asking about.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">4</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>The RTO road test at Nayapalli is straightforward if you've practised the basics.</strong> The test route near the Regional Transport Office is not complicated, but first-timers get nervous. Schools that take you on that specific route before test day — a few on this list do — give you a real advantage.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">5</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>Don't go by fees alone.</strong> The difference between a ₹3,000 school and a ₹5,500 school in BBSR often comes down to the instructor you get. Ask around in your neighbourhood or colony. Someone who learned there recently is a better reference than any listing — including this one.</div>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <div class="verdict">
    <div class="v-tag">✅ ValueLayer Bottom Line</div>
    <p>For the best-reviewed overall: <strong>Gajapati</strong> (Nayapalli, 5.0 ⭐ with 1,175 reviews). For extra practice time: <strong>Gajanan</strong> (21-day course, IRC Village). For the Rasulgarh belt: <strong>Dream</strong> (budget-friendly, Sashikant Sir). For CSP/Damana: <strong>SOMSAI</strong>. For south BBSR: <strong>A-ONE</strong>. For full license processing with no RTO stress: <strong>Driveasy</strong>. And if you have time and want to spend almost nothing: the <strong>Government DTS</strong> near Master Canteen has been running since 1973 for a reason.</p>
