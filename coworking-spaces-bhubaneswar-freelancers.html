    <strong>No sponsored content — just what I actually found:</strong> I visited all six co-working spaces on February 17, 2026, to check current prices, desk availability, and the actual vibe. When I first started freelancing in BBSR, I was working from a plastic chair at my cousin's place near Vani Vihar — the internet dropped every time someone turned on the mixer. So I spent two days visiting six spaces across the city, from the glass-tower offices near Rasulgarh Esplanade to the quieter spots tucked behind the Saheed Nagar flyover. Here's what I found.

      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The moment I stepped out of the lift on the 6th floor of Esplanade One, I stopped comparing this to other co-working spaces in BBSR. Exospace operates at a different level. High ceilings, warm lighting — not the fluorescent nightmare you get at most places — and every desk has a power socket you can reach without unplugging your neighbour.</p>

  <p>I sat down, connected to the Wi-Fi, and ran a speed test on a Monday morning: consistently above 50 Mbps. Day passes are available but the team recommends booking ahead. Monthly shared desks start at ₹6,500. Private cabins are higher — they'll quote based on headcount.</p>

  <div class="pro-tip">
    <strong>💡 Exospace Insider:</strong> It's <em>inside a mall</em> — Domino's, a pharmacy, and a cinema are literally in the same building. For all-day work sessions, that matters more than you'd think. The backdrop on video calls does the talking when you're billing in dollars.
  </div>

  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Freelancers who occasionally need to impress a client on a video call, consultants billing international clients, and anyone who values premium infrastructure over budget pricing.</p>

  <!-- ═══════════════════ 2. FUN@WORK ═══════════════════ -->
  <h2 id="funatwork">2. Fun@Work — BMC Bhawani Mall, Saheed Nagar</h2>

  <div class="quick-ref">
    <div class="quick-card">
      <h4>📍 Location &amp; Hours</h4>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Address</td><td>3rd Floor, BMC Bhawani Mall, Saheed Nagar</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Hours</td><td>Mon–Sat, 9:00 AM – 8:00 PM (closed Sunday)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Phone</td><td>+91 70023 14015</td></tr>

    <div class="quick-card">
      <h4>💰 Pricing</h4>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Day Pass</td><td>₹599 (includes a latte)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Monthly Desk</td><td>₹5,999</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Café inside</td><td>Divine Bite Cafe</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Booking</td><td>WhatsApp or walk-in</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Everyone around the Saheed Nagar flyover area seems to have heard of Fun@Work but hasn't actually walked in. A freelance designer I met near the Pantaloons end of the road assumed it was "too corporate." It is the opposite of corporate. The day pass is a flat ₹599 and it comes with a cup of latte. There's a full café inside (Divine Bite Cafe) plus a games corner with table tennis and board games.</p>

  <p>The co-working floor has comfortable seating, enough sockets, and the Wi-Fi held steady throughout my visit. I ended up wasting 20 minutes on foosball with someone who works in digital marketing. No regrets.</p>

  <div class="verdict">
    <div class="v-tag">💰 Best Day Pass Value</div>
    <p>At ₹599 including a latte, Fun@Work's day pass is the <strong>best single-day value in the city right now</strong>. If you only need a workspace two or three times a week and aren't ready to commit monthly, this is the obvious starting point.</p>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Writers, designers, and social media folks who need short focused sessions. The day pass deal stands out — booking is as simple as a WhatsApp message.</p>

    <figcaption>What separates a good co-working space from a great one: reliable Wi-Fi above 30 Mbps, power sockets you can reach without asking your neighbour, and task lighting that doesn't give you a headache by 3 PM. All six spaces on this list were tested for exactly these things.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <!-- ═══════════════════ 3. COHOPERS ═══════════════════ -->
  <h2 id="cohopers">3. Cohopers Workstudio — DLF Cybercity, Patia</h2>

  <div class="quick-ref">
    <div class="quick-card">
      <h4>📍 Location &amp; Hours</h4>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Address</td><td>DLF Cyber City Road, Infocity, Patia (near Chandaka Industrial Estate)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Hours</td><td>Open 24 hours, 7 days a week</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Phone</td><td>+91 94372 61907</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Google Rating</td><td>⭐ 4.9/5 (56+ reviews)</td></tr>

        <tr><td>Monthly Desk</td><td>₹4,999 onwards</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Access</td><td>24 hours / 7 days</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Events</td><td>Hackathons &amp; startup meetups</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>If you freelance in tech — development, data, UI/UX — or if your clients are in the Infocity–DLF Cybercity corridor, Cohopers is the obvious choice. You're literally inside the same ecosystem as the IT companies. I passed three startup offices just walking from the parking lot to the lobby.</p>

  <p>The space itself is genuinely well-designed by BBSR standards — plants on the walls, warm task lighting, individual workstations with privacy screens. The team runs networking events and hackathons that draw a real startup crowd. They're open 24/7 — one of only two spaces on this list with round-the-clock access — which is a lifesaver when you're on a deadline at 2 AM.</p>

  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Tech freelancers, developers, and startup founders based in the Patia–Infocity belt. The 24/7 access and startup community are hard to match anywhere else in BBSR.</p>

  <!-- ═══════════════════ 4. COWORK VENUE IRC ═══════════════════ -->
  <h2 id="cowork-irc">4. Cowork Venue — IRC Village, Nayapalli</h2>

  <div class="quick-ref">
    <div class="quick-card">
      <h4>📍 Location &amp; Hours</h4>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Address</td><td>ND-7, VIP Colony, IRC Village (near Ginger Hotel, Nayapalli)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Hours</td><td>Mon–Sat, 9:30 AM – 8:30 PM</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Phone</td><td>+91 81448 68757</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Google Rating</td><td>⭐ 4.9/5 (36+ reviews)</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <div class="quick-card">
      <h4>💰 Pricing</h4>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Day Pass</td><td>~₹300–400</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Monthly Desk</td><td>₹4,000–6,500</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Private Cabin</td><td>Available</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Power cuts</td><td>Backup covered</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The first thing I noticed walking into Cowork Venue at the IRC Village was that it was genuinely quiet. Not "library-trying-to-be-an-office" quiet — the natural quiet of a space that was designed with focus in mind. Plants, natural light, and stress-relief games in the corner that looked actually used.</p>

  <p>Monthly plans start at just ₹4,000, making it one of the most affordable in its category. Private cabins are available if you need to hop on calls without background noise. One reviewer said they started coming here to escape the scheduled power cuts in their sector — reliable internet, spacious cabins, no load-shedding anxiety. That's a very BBSR problem, and this solves it.</p>

  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Consultants, writers, and anyone who finds working from home too distracting. Good value if you're in the old-city or Nayapalli side of BBSR.</p>

    <figcaption>Esplanade One Mall at Rasulgarh Industrial Estate — Exospace occupies the 6th floor of the same building where you'd go for movies or a Domino's run. The access to food, pharmacy, and entertainment during long work days is a genuine productivity advantage most reviews overlook.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <!-- ═══════════════════ 5. COWORK VENUE SAHEED NAGAR ═══════════════════ -->
  <h2 id="cowork-saheed">5. Cowork Venue — Saheed Nagar Branch</h2>

  <div class="quick-ref">
    <div class="quick-card">
      <h4>📍 Location &amp; Hours</h4>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Address</td><td>Plot 09, Gurukrupa Building, Saheed Nagar (near AMRI Hospitals)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Hours</td><td>Mon–Sat, 9:30 AM – 8:30 PM</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Phone</td><td>+91 81448 68757</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Google Rating</td><td>⭐ 5.0/5 (24+ reviews) — perfect score</td></tr>

        <tr><td>Central location</td><td>Near AMRI Hospitals</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The Saheed Nagar branch of Cowork Venue holds a perfect 5.0 rating on Google — and after spending a morning there, I believe it. The location is smart: the Gurukrupa building, a short walk from AMRI Hospitals (a landmark every auto driver in the city knows), right in central Bhubaneswar.</p>

  <p>Same pricing as the IRC Village branch, but slightly better pantry and arguably easier to reach from most parts of the city. The conference room needs advance booking but is well-equipped. Wi-Fi is reliable and the space stays calm even during peak hours.</p>

  <div class="verdict">
    <div class="v-tag">⭐ Highest Rated on This List</div>
    <p>If you're already spending your days around the Saheed Nagar–Master Canteen–Janpath belt, this is the most practical choice on this entire list. Perfect 5.0 rating with no sponsored reviews — that's rare in BBSR.</p>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Anyone based in or commuting through central BBSR. The highest-rated space I visited, full stop.</p>

  <!-- ═══════════════════ 6. BBSR OFFICE ═══════════════════ -->
  <h2 id="bbsr-office">6. Bhubaneswar Office — Kalinga Vihar</h2>

        <tr><td>24/7 access</td><td>Yes (except Sundays)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Other branches</td><td>Dumduma, Niladri Vihar</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>If the first five options feel too central or too expensive, Bhubaneswar Office in Kalinga Vihar is worth considering. It's a quieter, more residential pocket of BBSR — near the Loyla Hospital junction on the K-5 road. Not the most glamorous address, but a dependable workspace open 24 hours (except Sundays).</p>

  <p>The staff is known for being warm and personal — reviewers mention staff members by name, which tells you something about the community feel. They also run locations near Dumduma (near KIDS Hospital) and Niladri Vihar (near the Chandrasekharpur petrol pump), so if you're on the south or east side of the city, there may be a branch closer to you.</p>

  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Freelancers on a tight budget, night owls who need 24-hour access, and anyone living in the Kalinga Nagar–Dumduma corridor.</p>

  <h2 id="tips">A Few Things I Learned Visiting All of Them</h2>

  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">1</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>Call ahead for day passes</strong> Most spaces don't advertise walk-in rates on their website. A 2-minute call saves a surprise at the counter — and sometimes they'll mention a promotion or trial offer they haven't posted online.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">2</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>Ask about a trial day</strong> Almost every space in BBSR will let you try for one day before committing monthly. The ones that won't — I'd be cautious about signing anything with them.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">3</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>Check Sunday availability</strong> Most spaces are closed on Sundays. Only Cohopers (Patia) and Bhubaneswar Office (Kalinga Vihar) offer genuine 24/7 access — plan your week around this if Sunday work is part of your routine.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">4</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>Negotiate monthly rates in person</strong> The prices listed are starting points. If you're committing for 3+ months, you can often get 10–15% off. I confirmed this directly at two spaces on my visit — they won't advertise it but will offer it if you ask.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">5</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>Pick by your commute, not the rating</strong> The best co-working space in Bhubaneswar is the one you'll actually show up to. Figure out your auto route first — a ₹150 auto ride every day adds ₹3,000/month to your actual workspace cost.</div>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <div class="tips-box">
    <h3>🗺️ Quick Location Guide — Which Space for Which Area</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Patia / Infocity / DLF belt:</strong> Cohopers Workstudio — 24/7 access, startup community, tech ecosystem on your doorstep.</li>
      <li><strong>Saheed Nagar / Master Canteen / Janpath:</strong> Cowork Venue Saheed Nagar (perfect rating) or Fun@Work (best day pass).</li>
      <li><strong>Rasulgarh / Bomikhal / Cuttack Road belt:</strong> Exospace — premium space, mall access, strong Wi-Fi, worth the ₹6,500+ monthly if you bill international.</li>
      <li><strong>IRC Village / Nayapalli / VSS Nagar:</strong> Cowork Venue IRC Village — quiet, affordable, easy to reach from the old-city belt.</li>
      <li><strong>Kalinga Nagar / Dumduma / KIIT area:</strong> Bhubaneswar Office Kalinga Vihar — multiple branches nearby, 24/7 access, budget-friendly.</li>
      <li><strong>Night owls and deadline crunchers:</strong> Cohopers (Patia) or Bhubaneswar Office — the only two with genuine 24-hour access.</li>
    </ol>
