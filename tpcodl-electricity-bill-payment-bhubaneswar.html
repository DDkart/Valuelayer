    <strong>Verified on the ground:</strong> I visited the TPCODL Customer Care office at Power House Square, Unit-8, Bhubaneswar on February 17, 2026, to confirm current contact details, payment procedures, and — most usefully — the exact escalation steps that actually get billing errors corrected, as told to me by a counter staff member who has been handling complaints there for six years. Most people in Bhubaneswar have one electricity-related crisis per year they are completely unprepared for. This guide covers all of it: payment, correction, escalation, and every office address you need.

  <!-- ═══════════════════ WHAT IS TPCODL ═══════════════════ -->
  <h2 id="what-is-tpcodl">What Is TPCODL and Who Does It Cover?</h2>

  <p>TPCODL — TP Central Odisha Distribution Limited — is a joint venture between Tata Power and the Odisha Government that supplies electricity to all of Bhubaneswar, along with Cuttack, Puri, Khurda, Dhenkanal, Nayagarh, and five other districts in central Odisha. If you live anywhere within the <strong>Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation</strong> limits — Patia, Chandrasekharpur, Old Town, Rasulgarh, Nayapalli, Niladri Vihar — your electricity is managed by TPCODL.</p>

  <p>The organisation was formerly called CESU (Central Electricity Supply Utility of Odisha) until Tata Power took over distribution operations. Many older residents and even some meter reader slips still say CESU — it is the same organisation, now rebranded as TPCODL.</p>

  <div class="verdict">
    <div class="v-tag">⚡ Key ID to Save Right Now</div>
    <p>Your <strong>Consumer Number</strong> — printed on every electricity bill — is the single most important reference for anything you do with TPCODL. Save it in your phone. Every payment, every complaint, every meter-related query requires it.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- ═══════════════════ PAYMENT ═══════════════════ -->
  <h2 id="payment">How to Pay Your Electricity Bill</h2>

  <h3>💻 Online Payment (Fastest, No Charges)</h3>

  <div class="price-grid">
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">TPCODL Consumer Portal</span><span class="value">portal.tpcentralodisha.com</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">TPCODL Mitra App</span><span class="value">Play Store / App Store</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">UPI (PhonePe / GPay / Paytm)</span><span class="value">No surcharge from TPCODL</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Bajaj Pay / FreeCharge / BillDesk</span><span class="value">Up to 2% convenience fee</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Net Banking / Debit Card</span><span class="value">No fee via direct portal</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Credit Card via UPI apps</span><span class="value">1.5–2% may apply</span></div>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Method 1 — TPCODL Consumer Portal (Most Direct):</strong> Go to "Quick Pay" on the homepage, enter your Consumer Number, fetch your bill, and pay. No registration required for Quick Pay. Accepts payment 24 hours a day, confirms instantly, and charges zero platform fee. This is the best method — no middleman, no markup.</p>

  <p><strong>Method 2 — TPCODL Mitra App:</strong> The official TPCODL app beyond just bill payment. It lets you check power outage status, register complaints for billing errors and burnt meters, view your last 6 months of consumption history, and — crucially — verify the identity of any TPCODL employee who visits your home. That last feature matters given the number of fake meter reader incidents reported across Patia and Chandrasekharpur. Download it; it is more useful than the website for day-to-day monitoring.</p>

  <p><strong>Method 3 — UPI / PhonePe / GPay / Paytm:</strong> Select "TPCODL" under electricity bill payment, enter your Consumer Number, and pay. Instant confirmation. Some apps run periodic cashback offers on electricity payments — worth checking before you pay.</p>

  <div class="pro-tip">
    <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> Always pay via the direct TPCODL portal or a UPI app to avoid the convenience fee (up to 2%) charged by third-party platforms like Bajaj Pay. On a ₹2,000 bill, that's ₹40 saved every single month — ₹480 a year.
  </div>

  <h3>🏢 Offline Payment (For Those Without Reliable Internet)</h3>

  <p>TPCODL payment counters at all subdivision offices accept cash and cheque. Payment counter hours: <strong>10 AM – 5 PM, Monday to Saturday</strong> (closed second Saturday and all public holidays).</p>

  <!-- ═══════════════════ CONSUMER NUMBER ═══════════════════ -->
  <h2 id="consumer-number">How to Find Your Consumer Number (If You Lost It)</h2>

  <p>Your Consumer Number appears on every TPCODL electricity bill. If you have never seen your bill — common for tenants in buildings where the landlord pays the bill — here is how to find it:</p>

  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">1</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>Check the meter box</strong> In most Bhubaneswar buildings the consumer number is written in marker or stuck as a label on or near the electricity meter itself. Check the meter box in your flat or on your floor landing.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">2</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>Ask your landlord</strong> For tenants who don't manage the bill directly — which is most people in Patia and Chandrasekharpur — ask your landlord. It is on the bill they receive and on the connection papers filed during construction.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">3</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>Call 1912</strong> Give your registered address and mobile number. The operator can retrieve the Consumer Number linked to that address within a few minutes.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">4</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>Via the Consumer Portal</strong> Use the "Forgot Consumer Number" option on portal.tpcentralodisha.com — it sends an OTP to the mobile number registered with the account.</div>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- ═══════════════════ UNDERSTANDING YOUR BILL ═══════════════════ -->
  <h2 id="understanding-bill">Understanding Your Bill (What Each Line Means)</h2>

  <p>Most billing errors go unnoticed because people do not read their bills. Here is what the key lines on a TPCODL bill actually mean:</p>

  <!-- ═══════════════════ GRIEVANCE ESCALATION ═══════════════════ -->
  <h2 id="grievance">What to Do When Your Bill Is Wrong — Step by Step</h2>

  <p>The billing error process has four levels. Knowing all four — and the time limits at each level — is what separates people who get corrections processed from people who keep paying wrong bills for months.</p>

  <h3>Level 1: Call 1912 or 1800-345-7122 (Start Here)</h3>

  <p>The toll-free number 1912 is free from any mobile or landline in Odisha. When you call, the IVR menu matters:</p>

  <div class="tips-box">
    <h3>📞 IVR Menu — Follow This Exact Order</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Press 1</strong> — Power supply / voltage issues</li>
      <li><strong>Press 2</strong> — Safety, fire, emergency</li>
      <li><strong>Press 3</strong> — Meter reading, billing, payment query ← <strong>your option for billing errors</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Press 9</strong> — Speak to a customer care agent directly</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <p>Always press <strong>3</strong> first — it logs your query specifically as a billing issue, routing it to the billing team. When connected, give your Consumer Number, describe the error, and ask for a <strong>complaint reference number</strong>. Write it down. Without a reference number, you have no proof the complaint was registered.</p>

  <div class="price-grid">
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">TPCODL WhatsApp (billing)</span><span class="value">+91 99378 75999</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">TPCODL WhatsApp (general)</span><span class="value">+91 94371 58670</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Email (customer care)</span><span class="value">customercare@tpcentralodisha.com</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Email (grievance)</span><span class="value">grievance@tpcentralodisha.com</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">WhatsApp response time</span><span class="value">2–4 hours (business hours)</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Level 1 resolution time</span><span class="value">15 working days</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>WhatsApp is genuinely usable — send a photo of the disputed bill and they respond during business hours. Email creates a written trail, which is useful if the error is not resolved and you need to escalate.</p>

  <h3>Level 2: Visit Your Sub-Division Office in Person</h3>

  <p>If the phone complaint is not resolved within 15 working days, or if the error involves a physical meter issue (burnt meter, wrong reading), visit your TPCODL subdivision office. Bring: your original bill, a copy, your Consumer Number, your Aadhaar, and the reference number from your Level 1 call. Ask to meet the <strong>Assistant Engineer (AE)</strong> or <strong>Sub-Divisional Officer (SDO)</strong>. Do not just hand papers to the counter staff and leave — request an acknowledgement stamp on your application.</p>

  </figure>

  <h3>Level 3: TPCODL Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum (CGRF)</h3>

  <p>If Levels 1 and 2 both fail, you have the legal right to escalate to the CGRF — the Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum, an independent body mandated by the Electricity Act 2003 and OERC regulations.</p>

  <div class="verdict">
    <div class="v-tag">⚠️ Critical Time Limit</div>
    <p>Your CGRF complaint must be filed within <strong>30 days</strong> of either: the expiry of the 15-working-day resolution window, or receipt of TPCODL's final response — whichever comes first. Missing this window is the most common mistake. Mark your calendar the day you file Level 1.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="quick-ref">
    <div class="quick-card">
      <h4>CGRF Bhubaneswar Circle-I</h4>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Covers</td><td>Central &amp; northern Bhubaneswar</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Address</td><td>Qr. No. VR-1, Power House Colony, Unit-8 — 751012</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Phone</td><td>0674-2562272</td></tr>

        <tr><td>Phone</td><td>06755-221529</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Attach to your CGRF complaint: copies of all previous complaints filed, TPCODL's responses (if any), the original disputed bills, and any meter reading photos you have taken.</p>

  <h3>Level 4: Electricity Ombudsman (Final Escalation)</h3>

  <p>If the CGRF's decision is also unsatisfactory, you can appeal to the <strong>Electricity Ombudsman</strong> within 30 days of receiving the CGRF order.</p>

  <!-- ═══════════════════ COMMON BILLING ERRORS ═══════════════════ -->
  <h2 id="common-errors">The Most Common Billing Errors — And How to Prove Each One</h2>

  <h3>⚡ Error 1: Estimated Bill (Average Bill)</h3>
  <p>When the meter reader cannot access your meter for a month or two — locked gate, dog in compound, nobody home during reading time — TPCODL generates an "average bill" based on historical consumption. When the actual reading is eventually taken, the difference creates a catch-up bill that looks shockingly high.</p>
  <p><strong>How to identify it:</strong> The bill will show "E" or "Estimated" in the Current Reading column. <strong>What to do:</strong> Call 1912, press 3, and request a "special meter reading." TPCODL will send a meter reader at a scheduled time. Any overcharge from the estimated period is adjusted in the next bill.</p>

  <h3>⚡ Error 2: Wrong Meter Reading Entered</h3>
  <p>The meter reader misread a digit — ₹12,500 bill appears when you typically pay ₹800. More common in Old Town and Rasulgarh where meters are old, digits are worn, and readers are covering large routes quickly.</p>
  <p><strong>How to prove it:</strong> The monthly photo you took of your meter. If the photo shows 4,230 units and the bill shows a closing reading of 42,300 — the reader entered an extra zero — your photo wins the argument immediately. <strong>What to do:</strong> File via 1912 (press 3), attach the meter photo to +91 99378 75999 on WhatsApp, and ask for meter re-reading. TPCODL is required to send a verification team within 7 working days.</p>

  <h3>⚡ Error 3: Neighbour's Consumption on Your Meter</h3>
  <p>Surprisingly common in newly constructed buildings in Kalarahanga, Raghunathpur, and other areas with recent construction, where electrical contractors wire meters incorrectly. Signs: your bill is consistently ₹200–₹400 higher than actual consumption. Verify by switching off your main switch entirely for 10 minutes — if your meter still spins, someone else's load is on your meter.</p>
  <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Film the spinning meter with your main switch off. This video is your evidence. File a complaint in person at the subdivision office. Ask the SDO to send a technical team for "meter audit and connection verification." The process takes 2–4 weeks but the correction is permanent and you are entitled to a refund.</p>

  <h3>⚡ Error 4: Previous Tenant's Arrear on Your New Connection</h3>
  <p>You move into a flat — the previous tenant left without paying three months of bills. TPCODL transfers the arrear to the new consumer at the same address. This is technically incorrect — arrears follow the person, not the property, for residential connections. But it happens.</p>
  <p><strong>What to do:</strong> File a written complaint at the subdivision office with proof that the connection predates your tenancy (your rental agreement start date vs. the arrear period). Request the arrear to be transferred to the previous consumer's name. Ask for the Divisional Manager's counter signature on the acknowledgement.</p>

  <!-- ═══════════════════ THE ONE HABIT ═══════════════════ -->
  <h2 id="habit">The One Habit That Solves 80% of Billing Problems</h2>

  <p>Take a photo of your electricity meter on the 1st of every month. Not a video, not a screenshot — a quick dated phone photo of the meter display. It takes 15 seconds. If your bill is ever wrong, this photo is the evidence that resolves it in one call. If you never need it, it costs you nothing.</p>

  <div class="tips-box">
    <h3>📸 Monthly Meter Photo — Who Needs This Most</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Patia residents</strong> — High-density area with large route loads for meter readers. Estimated bills are common in monsoon months.</li>
      <li><strong>Raghunathpur &amp; Kalarahanga</strong> — New construction zones with active wiring errors. Neighbour-on-your-meter cases appear here regularly.</li>
      <li><strong>Old Town &amp; Rasulgarh</strong> — Older meters where digit misreads happen at higher rates than newer meter zones.</li>
      <li><strong>Any standalone building</strong> — Where your meter is in a locked enclosure and the reader may estimate rather than read.</li>
      <li><strong>New tenants (0–6 months)</strong> — Highest risk period for inheriting previous tenant arrears. Document meter reading on move-in day.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="verdict">
    <div class="v-tag">✅ Bottom Line</div>
    <p>TPCODL's grievance process works — but only if you follow it in sequence, get reference numbers at every step, and meet the 30-day CGRF filing window. The IVR option is Press 3 for billing. The WhatsApp number for billing is +91 99378 75999. And the one habit that prevents most problems: photograph your meter on the 1st of every month.</p>
