  <div class="intro-block">
    <strong>Visited in person, February 17, 2026:</strong> The strip running from the Police Outpost junction toward the BMC Bhawani Mall end of Saheed Nagar has become Bhubaneswar's most concentrated laptop repair zone. Within about half a kilometre you have at least six serious repair shops, two authorized brand service centres, and smaller walk-in places tucked in the lane behind Hotel Empire. The big question most people have: <strong>is it worth going to the authorized service centre and paying more, or does the third-party shop across the road give you the same result for half the price?</strong> The answer depends on your situation, your laptop model, and exactly what is broken. Here's everything I found.

  <!-- ─── PRICE REALITY ────────────────────────────────────────── -->
  <h2 id="price-reality">Screen Replacement Price Reality Check</h2>

  <p>Screen replacement is the most common major repair request in BBSR and the best way to compare costs between authorized and third-party. Here is what I found by visiting every shop and requesting quotes on the same common models.</p>

  <div class="price-grid">
    <div class="price-row price-header"><span class="label">Model / Category</span><span class="value">Authorized → Third-Party</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">HP 15s / Pavilion (15.6" FHD)</span><span class="value">₹9,500–13,000 → ₹6,000–7,500</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Lenovo IdeaPad 14" FHD</span><span class="value">₹10,000–12,000 → ₹5,000–7,000</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Dell Inspiron 15 (FHD)</span><span class="value">₹9,000–16,000 → ₹5,500–8,000</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Acer Aspire / standard range</span><span class="value">₹8,500–15,000 → ₹5,500–7,500</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Gaming (Nitro/TUF/IdeaPad Gaming 144Hz)</span><span class="value">₹12,000–20,000 → ₹8,000–13,000</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">MacBook (Pro/Air — any model)</span><span class="value">₹28,000+ → ₹18,000–26,000</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class="pro-tip">
    <strong>💡 What the price difference actually buys at authorized centres:</strong> Genuine OEM panel (same manufacturer), 3–6 month parts warranty, certified technician, and — critically — the laptop's remaining warranty stays intact. Third-party saves ₹2,000–5,000 on standard models. The saving is real, but so is the trade-off if the laptop is still in its warranty period.
  </div>

  <p>The honest summary: <strong>for a budget laptop under ₹40,000 that is out of warranty, go third-party.</strong> For a laptop still under warranty, always go authorized first. For premium laptops — XPS, MacBook, Legion, ZenBook Pro — only go to a shop you have independently verified, because a bad repair on a ₹1.5 lakh machine is a very expensive mistake.</p>

  <!-- ─── ADD INFOTECH ──────────────────────────────────────────── -->
  <h2 id="add-infotech">1. Add Infotech — Opposite Indian Bank, Near Police Outpost</h2>

      <table>
        <tr><td>HP 15s / Lenovo IdeaPad</td><td>₹6,000–7,500</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Dell Inspiron 15</td><td>₹6,500–8,000</td></tr>

        <tr><td>Warranty on work</td><td>1–3 months (confirm before leaving)</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This is consistently the most personally recommended shop in the Saheed Nagar repair corridor. The shop is run by <strong>Deepak Kumar Pradhan</strong>, and almost every review mentions him by name — which in itself tells you something. When a repair shop has a reputation built around one knowledgeable person rather than just a brand name, you usually get honest, accountable service.</p>

  <div class="verdict">
    <div class="v-tag">⭐ ValueLayer Top Pick — Third-Party</div>
    <p>Deepak is described across reviews as <em>"transparent — no hidden costs or gimmicks"</em> and <em>"addresses issues to the core."</em> A student waiting outside told me she'd come back because he explained the problem in plain Odia before touching the laptop, told her what the repair would cost, and stuck to that number. That's rarer than it should be on this strip.</p>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Good for:</strong> All general laptop repairs — display, keyboard, battery, motherboard issues, slow performance. Ideal for budget and mid-range laptops out of warranty. First stop recommendation for most Saheed Nagar residents.</p>

  <!-- ─── SPECTRUM TECHNOLOGY ──────────────────────────────────── -->
  <h2 id="spectrum">2. Spectrum Technology — Near Alok Varati Towers</h2>

  <div class="quick-ref">
    <div class="quick-card">

        <tr><td>Type</td><td>Third-party + authorized capability (Asus, Apple)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Google Rating</td><td>⭐ 4.7 / 5  (2,790+ reviews)</td></tr>

      <table>
        <tr><td>Standard budget/mid-range</td><td>₹7,000–10,000</td></tr>
        <tr><td>MacBook (Pro/Air)</td><td>₹18,000–26,000</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Asus ROG / gaming screens</td><td>₹12,000–18,000</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Asus parts</td><td>Genuine (confirmed by reviewers)</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>With nearly 2,800 reviews, Spectrum Technology is the most-reviewed laptop repair shop in this entire zone — and that volume of feedback over time builds a more reliable picture than any individual account. What makes Spectrum distinct is its positioning: it handles repairs for <strong>Asus</strong> with genuine spare parts (reviewers specifically confirm this for ROG and TUF series), and services <strong>Apple MacBooks</strong> — a claim few shops in BBSR can make credibly.</p>

  <p>One reviewer from Mumbai came here in an emergency with a MacBook display issue and had the motherboard repaired within 4–5 hours. For a Mac repair in Bhubaneswar, that's a notable result. One older review flags a motherboard repair where the same issue returned — always ask for a specific diagnosis in writing before paying for any motherboard job, regardless of where you go.</p>

  <p><strong>Good for:</strong> Asus laptops specifically (gaming and standard) where genuine parts matter. MacBook repairs in BBSR. General repairs where volume and parts availability beat the smaller shops.</p>

    <figcaption>Screen replacement cost comparison across common laptop models — authorized centres (HP BMC Mall, Acer, Dell R Techno) versus third-party shops (Add Infotech, CompuServe, Spectrum) on the Saheed Nagar strip. For a standard HP 15s or Lenovo IdeaPad: ₹6,000–7,500 third-party vs ₹9,500–13,000 authorized. The saving is real. The trade-off is warranty validity — if the laptop is still covered, authorized is always the right call first. Prices quoted on February 17, 2026.</figcaption>

  <!-- ─── IT CARE ────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->
  <h2 id="it-care">3. IT Care — Plot 121, Saheed Nagar Road</h2>

  <div class="quick-ref">
    <div class="quick-card">

      <table>
        <tr><td>Address</td><td>Plot 121, Saheed Nagar Road (near Police Outpost, same cluster as Computer House)</td></tr>

      <table>
        <tr><td>Standard FHD screens</td><td>₹7,000–9,000</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Turnaround</td><td>Same-day or next-day for standard jobs</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Pricing note</td><td>Slightly higher than Add Infotech — verify upfront</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Transparency</td><td>Good — clear communication on diagnosis</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>IT Care sits in the dense cluster near the Saheed Nagar Police Outpost, right next to Computer House. It does strong repair volumes and generally gets good marks for transparency in pricing and quick turnaround. One review noted charges were <em>"on the higher side"</em> compared to other centres for the same job — IT Care prices slightly higher than Add Infotech for equivalent repairs. However, reviews suggest quality work and clear communication about what is wrong.</p>

  <p>One gaming laptop incident stands out from reviews: a Predator Helios cleaning that caused an unexpected chip failure on the bench, which the team fixed at their own cost. That kind of ownership after a mistake is rare and worth noting as a mark of accountability.</p>

  <p><strong>Good for:</strong> Reliable mid-range repairs. Good choice if Add Infotech has a queue — it's steps away and the quality is comparable. Over 1,000 reviews makes this one of the most consistently evaluated shops on the strip.</p>

  <!-- ─── COMPUSERVE ─────────────────────────────────────────────── -->
  <h2 id="compuserve">4. CompuServe — Swash Lane, Near Hotel Empire</h2>

  <div class="quick-ref">
    <div class="quick-card">

        <tr><td>Type</td><td>Third-party — repairs + sales</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Google Rating</td><td>⭐ 4.9 / 5  (668+ reviews)</td></tr>

        <tr><td>Note</td><td>Call ahead for specific screen models</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>CompuServe is slightly set back from the main Saheed Nagar road — in the lane behind Hotel Empire, known locally as the <em>"EPF Colony side."</em> Once you know the Hotel Empire landmark, it's easy to find. A 4.9 rating with 668 reviews is a strong signal. Staff are described across reviews as honest and knowledgeable, and the shop has a dedicated following among the gaming community in BBSR for PC builds and component sales.</p>

  <div class="verdict">
    <div class="v-tag">🏆 Highest Rated Third-Party — 4.9 ⭐</div>
    <p>CompuServe's combination of repair quality, competitive screen pricing (₹5,500–7,500 for standard displays — among the lowest on this list), and a reliable reputation for custom PC builds makes it the most well-rounded third-party option in the Saheed Nagar zone. The one caveat: it's off the main road, so first-time visitors should use Hotel Empire as their landmark.</p>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Good for:</strong> Laptop repairs, custom PC builds, component sourcing. Excellent option for students and IT professionals in the EPF Colony–Hotel Empire lane area of Saheed Nagar.</p>

  <!-- ─── NUMLOCK ─────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->
  <h2 id="numlock">5. Numlock IT Solutions — EPF Colony, Hotel Empire Lane</h2>

        <tr><td>Sunday availability</td><td>❌ Closed — plan accordingly</td></tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the same Hotel Empire lane as CompuServe, Numlock is a smaller shop handling the same range of repairs — laptops, desktops, printers. It's slightly less crowded than the main-road shops, which can work in your favour for quicker service on standard repairs. Display flickering, keyboard replacements, and slow-system cleanups are handled efficiently based on reviews.</p>

  <p>One review flagged a longer turnaround than expected and pricing on the higher side for the work done. Get a quote upfront and confirm a realistic completion timeline before leaving your device. Being closed on Sundays is worth noting if you're planning a weekend visit — CompuServe or SMS Technology are your alternatives that day.</p>

  <p><strong>Good for:</strong> Standard repairs for residents of EPF Colony and the side lanes behind Hotel Empire who prefer a smaller, less busy environment than the main strip shops.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>SMS Technology is at the INOX end of Saheed Nagar — BMC Bhawani Mall side — making it the most convenient shop for people coming from the Saheed Nagar flyover or the Acharya Vihar direction. Screen replacement is handled regularly; one reviewer mentioned getting a clear estimate upfront with faster-than-expected completion.</p>

  <div class="pro-tip">
    <strong>💡 SMS Technology Caution:</strong> One customer had an unsatisfying diagnosis experience — ₹300 charged for opening the laptop without a clear finding, followed by a vague repair quote. If you visit, ask specifically what the ₹300 diagnosis fee covers and whether it is credited toward any repair work you proceed with. This is a standard practice at many shops; just confirm it explicitly before agreeing.
  </div>

  <p><strong>Good for:</strong> People coming from the INOX/BMC Bhawani Mall end of Saheed Nagar who don't want to walk the full length of the main road to reach Add Infotech or CompuServe.</p>

The third-party shops are clustered toward the Police Outpost end; the authorized HP centre is at the BMC Bhawani Mall / INOX end.

  </div>

  <p>The HP Service Centre inside BMC Bhawani Mall is the easiest authorized centre to walk into — the same mall with the Fun@Work co-working space and the INOX multiplex. For any HP laptop still under warranty, this is your required first stop. Screen replacements use genuine HP panels with 3–6 month parts warranty, and the technicians are certified HP staff.</p>

  <div class="verdict">
    <div class="v-tag">⚠️ Important Warning — HP Authorized Parts Authenticity</div>
    <p>Multiple reviewers have flagged that <strong>spare parts sold here don't always come in sealed HP-original packaging</strong>, with no easy way to verify authenticity. One reviewer warned in capital letters to check part authenticity before accepting any component. If you're paying authorized-centre prices specifically for genuine parts, ask to see the screen panel in original HP-sealed packaging before the technician installs it. This is your right. Don't feel awkward about asking — several customers already have, and raised it publicly in reviews.</p>

  <p>Sunday hours are limited (closes at 2 PM) — plan accordingly. <strong>Go here when:</strong> Your HP laptop is in warranty. Out-of-warranty HP repairs are more cost-effectively handled at third-party shops like Add Infotech or CompuServe.</p>

  <p>The Acer authorized centre's 3.2 rating with 59 reviews is the most honest data point on this entire list. One specific reviewer account is worth sharing: they paid ₹5,000 for a keyboard replacement after a technician diagnosed a <em>"keyboard issue"</em> — without opening the laptop. The replacement did not fix the actual problem. A diagnosis that sounds like it did not happen properly before a part is ordered and installed is a serious concern at any service centre.</p>

  <p>There is only one technician for the entire centre, which means everything depends on that one person's availability and skill on a given day. The hours (10:30 AM–5:30 PM, Monday–Saturday only) are the tightest of any centre on this list — tighter even than the Sunday-limited HP centre.</p>

  <p><strong>Go here only when:</strong> Your Acer laptop is under warranty and you must use an authorized centre. For out-of-warranty Acer repairs, Spectrum Technology and Add Infotech both handle Acer models with significantly better-reviewed results.</p>

  <p>The Dell authorized centre at Plot A23 has fewer reviews than the others but a solid 4.5 average, with the team consistently described as professional, transparent about problems, and quick in turnaround for standard repairs. A notable detail: it also services Asus laptops under an authorized capacity — worth knowing if you have an Asus and want a formal authorized repair without going to Spectrum.</p>

  <p><strong>Go here when:</strong> Your Dell laptop is under warranty. Also a reasonable option for out-of-warranty Dell repairs given the good review profile — just get a written quote before proceeding. For Asus warranty work it's one of the few authorized options in the BBSR area.</p>

    <h3>📋 5 Things to Always Do Before Leaving Your Laptop</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Get a written or WhatsApp quote</strong> before authorizing any work — amount, parts, and labour broken out separately.</li>
      <li><strong>Ask what type of screen panel</strong> they're fitting — OEM original, OEM-grade compatible, or generic. These are different things at different price points.</li>
      <li><strong>Ask whether the quote includes labour and GST.</strong> What sounds like ₹6,000 can become ₹7,200 after these are added if you don't confirm upfront.</li>
      <li><strong>Ask about the warranty on parts and labour.</strong> Good third-party shops typically give 1–3 months. Authorized centres give 3–6 months on parts. Get this in writing or WhatsApp.</li>
      <li><strong>For HP Authorized:</strong> Ask to see the screen panel in sealed HP-original packaging before installation. Multiple customers have raised authenticity concerns publicly — you are entitled to ask.</li>
    </ol>
