  <div class="intro-block">
    <strong>Ground-verified:</strong> I personally spoke with parents outside several school gates in Patia, Chandrasekharpur, and Nayapalli on February 17, 2026, to cross-check current fee information. What I found surprised me — the gap between government-run schools and top private institutions is enormous. Every auto-wala near Infocity Chowk has an opinion, every uncle at Ekamra Haat has a recommendation, and every WhatsApp group in your housing society is flooded with "which school is best?" debates. So I decided to actually dig into the numbers, visit the areas, and talk to real parents to cut through the noise.

  <!-- ═══════════════════ ODM ═══════════════════ -->
  <h2 id="odm">1. ODM Public School — Sishu Vihar, Patia</h2>

  <p>ODM is probably the most talked-about CBSE school in the entire city right now. Ranked among India's Top 5 schools by multiple surveys and regularly topping Odisha's Class X and XII results, this is the school every parent in the Patia–Chandrasekharpur belt is angling for.</p>

  <div class="verdict">
    <div class="v-tag">📍 Location</div>
    <p>Infocity Avenue, Sishu Vihar, Patia — near the IT corridor, hard to miss the big blue gate. A parent I met waiting outside told me her daughter had cleared ODM's baseline entrance exam on the second attempt: <em>"Paisa lagthe, kintu result bhi aste."</em> (It costs money, but the results also come.)</p>
  </div>

  <h3>💰 Fee Structure 2026-27</h3>
  <div class="price-grid">
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Day scholar (annual)</span><span class="value">₹1.8L – ₹2.5L/year</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Residential / boarding (annual)</span><span class="value">Up to ₹4.75L/year</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Boarding includes</span><span class="value">Hostel + food + tuition</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Admission fee</span><span class="value">Charged separately at enrolment</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Payment structure</span><span class="value">Quarterly instalments</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">OSAT scholarship</span><span class="value">Merit-based, for Class XI entry</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class="pro-tip">
    <strong>💡 ODM Tip:</strong> The OSAT (ODM Scholarship Entrance Test) for Class XI gives genuine merit-based fee discounts — worth checking if your child is academically strong. The N40 batch (only 40 seats per stream) offers integrated JEE/NEET coaching alongside CBSE from Class XI. Highly competitive to get into but worth pursuing.
  </div>

  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Parents who want top board results and don't mind the premium price tag. ODM's track record of producing Odisha state toppers in Class X and XII is consistent and well-documented.</p>

  <!-- ═══════════════════ SAI ═══════════════════ -->
  <h2 id="sai">2. SAI International School — Chandrasekharpur</h2>

  <p>SAI International is the school that put Bhubaneswar on the national school map. Established in 2008, it runs dual affiliation — CBSE and Cambridge International (CAIE) — which means your child can pursue IGCSE from Class VIII onwards if needed. The 8-acre campus sits right in the Chandrasekharpur IT pocket, making it a logical choice for families in that belt. Separate air-conditioned hostels for boys and girls — many outstation families from Koraput, Sambalpur, and Rayagada prefer it for this reason.</p>

  <h3>💰 Fee Structure 2026-27</h3>
  <div class="price-grid">
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Monthly tuition (day scholar)</span><span class="value">₹9,460 – ₹13,400/month</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Annual tuition total (day scholar)</span><span class="value">₹1.13L – ₹1.61L/year</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">One-time admission fee</span><span class="value">₹20,000</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Residential fees</span><span class="value">Contact admissions desk directly</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Curriculum</span><span class="value">CBSE + Cambridge CAIE (IGCSE)</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Campus size</span><span class="value">8 acres, Infocity roundabout</span></div>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Families who want CBSE plus international curriculum exposure, or those whose child may eventually move abroad for higher studies. The IGCSE option from Class VIII is genuinely rare in Bhubaneswar.</p>

    <img src="images/cbse-school-fee-planning.jpg" alt="School fee planning guide — CBSE schools Bhubaneswar 2026-27" />
    <figcaption>When budgeting for CBSE schools in Bhubaneswar, always build in 15–25% extra on top of core tuition fees for transport, books, uniforms, lab fees, and extracurricular activities. These add-ons are rarely mentioned upfront in the school brochure.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <!-- ═══════════════════ DAV UNIT-VIII ═══════════════════ -->
  <h2 id="dav-unit8">3. DAV Public School, Unit-VIII — Nayapalli</h2>

  <p>DAV Unit-VIII is a Bhubaneswar institution in the truest sense — established in 1971, with over 50 years of heritage and more than 3,800 students. This is the school where many of today's judges, engineers, and government officials studied, and parents love dropping that fact into every school-choice conversation. The Nayapalli campus has a slower, more community-oriented feel compared to the slicker IT-corridor schools. Teachers tend to stay longer, which parents say matters a great deal.</p>

  <div class="verdict">
    <div class="v-tag">📍 Location</div>
    <p>Unit-VIII, P.O. Nayapalli — near the old residential quarters, walkable from the VSS Nagar area. One of the most well-connected school locations in the city — accessible from almost any direction without a major highway crossing.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>💰 Fee Structure 2026-27</h3>
  <div class="price-grid">
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Total annual cost (new admission)</span><span class="value">₹98,880 – ₹1,06,260</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Includes</span><span class="value">Security deposit + tuition + admission fees</span></div>
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Payment structure</span><span class="value">Instalments (schedule at admission time)</span></div>

    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">School type</span><span class="value">Day school (Arya Samaj values)</span></div>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Families looking for a trusted, value-for-money CBSE school with decades of proven results — and without the pressure of a premium price tag. The ₹99K–₹1.06L annual range makes this one of the most affordable reputed CBSE schools in the city.</p>

  <!-- ═══════════════════ DAV CSP ═══════════════════ -->
  <h2 id="dav-csp">4. DAV Public School — Chandrasekharpur</h2>

  <p>The newer of the two major DAV campuses in the city, carrying the same Arya Samaj values with more modern infrastructure. It consistently performs well in board exams and has become popular with families who've moved into newer residential colonies around the Kalinga Nagar and KIIT area. A short tempo-ride from Damana Square.</p>

  <h3>💰 Fee Structure 2026-27</h3>
  <div class="price-grid">
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Annual fees (approximate)</span><span class="value">₹95,000 – ₹1,10,000/year</span></div>

    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">School type</span><span class="value">Day school</span></div>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Families in the newer Chandrasekharpur–Kalinga Nagar residential belt who want DAV's trusted brand without travelling across town to Nayapalli. Slightly newer campus than Unit-VIII. Confirm exact fee components directly with the school for your child's class.</p>

  <!-- ═══════════════════ KV ═══════════════════ -->
  <h2 id="kv">5. Kendriya Vidyalaya — Multiple Campuses</h2>

  <p>If you work in a central government department, defence, or paramilitary services, KV should be your first stop — not your last resort. The fee structure here is genuinely the most affordable you'll find for quality CBSE education anywhere in the country.</p>

  <p><strong>Key Campuses in Bhubaneswar:</strong> Pokhariput, Unit-VI, Bhubaneswar-I (near RRL), Bhubaneswar-II.</p>

  <h3>💰 Fee Structure 2026-27</h3>

  <div class="tips-box">
    <h3>🎓 What ₹6,000/year Looks Like at KV</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>A family with a daughter in Class X</strong> pays approximately ₹6,000 a year in total school fees. That is genuinely exceptional for a CBSE school with a national curriculum.</li>
      <li><strong>Admission priority order:</strong> Central government employees → Defence → Paramilitary → Others. If you're not in those categories, seats are hard to come by — apply early.</li>
      <li><strong>KVS online admissions portal:</strong> kvsonlineadmission.kvs.gov.in — check seat availability and the exact admission calendar for 2026-27 here.</li>
      <li><strong>Track record:</strong> A retired CRPF officer outside the Pokhariput gate told me: "Yahan padha ke mere teen bacche alag alag IITs mein hain." Sometimes the best education isn't the most expensive one.</li>

Parents living here can access the top three schools in the city within a 5 km radius. Commute from areas like Tamando or Patrapada can add ₹2,000–₹4,000/month to your school budget.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <!-- ═══════════════════ MOTHER'S ═══════════════════ -->
  <h2 id="mothers">6. Mother's Public School — Multiple Locations</h2>

  <p>Mother's Public School started in Odisha in 1991 as a daycare centre and has grown into a network educating over 7,000 students. Popular with middle-class families in Saheed Nagar market belt and the Rasulgarh–Khandagiri pockets who want a CBSE school without the Patia-corridor price tags.</p>

  <p><strong>Key Locations:</strong> Saheed Nagar, Rasulgarh, and Nayapalli (among others).</p>

  <h3>💰 Fee Structure 2026-27</h3>
  <div class="price-grid">
    <div class="price-row"><span class="label">Annual fees (branch &amp; class dependent)</span><span class="value">₹63,000 – ₹98,000/year</span></div>

  </div>

  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Families looking for solid CBSE education at a mid-range budget, especially those living in the southern and western parts of the city. The Saheed Nagar branch is the most accessible for residents of the central Bhubaneswar belt.</p>

  <!-- ═══════════════════ SAINIK ═══════════════════ -->
  <h2 id="sainik">7. Sainik School Bhubaneswar — Near Khandagiri</h2>

  <p>A fully residential boarding school, co-educational, affiliated with CBSE, and one of the most prestigious institutions of its type in Eastern India. Established in 1962, it has trained more than 2,000 officers for the armed forces and beyond. The school blends rigorous academics with physical and leadership training. Admission is through the All India Sainik Schools Entrance Examination (AISSEE).</p>

  <!-- ═══════════════════ WHAT PARENTS SAY ═══════════════════ -->
  <h2 id="parents">What Parents in Bhubaneswar Actually Say</h2>

  <p>Talking to parents outside these schools revealed a few patterns that no brochure will tell you:</p>

  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">1</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>Commute is the real hidden cost</strong> Parents near the Chandrasekharpur schools said the commute is a significant budget item — many families spend ₹2,000–₹4,000 a month on school buses from areas like Tamando, Patrapada, or the older Unit colonies. Add that to your annual fee calculation before comparing schools.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">2</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>DAV teachers stay longer</strong> Parents in the Nayapalli area consistently mentioned that DAV teachers tend to remain at the school for many years — something they feel contributes to better continuity of learning. At some newer premium schools, high faculty turnover was a quiet but recurring complaint.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">3</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>The KV surprise</strong> A retired CRPF officer standing outside the Pokhariput KV gate told me simply: "Yahan padha ke mere teen bacche alag alag IITs mein hain." (All three of my children who studied here are in different IITs.) The best education isn't always the most expensive one.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">4</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>ODM entrance is real</strong> ODM's baseline entrance exam for Classes I–IX and the OSAT for Class XI are not formalities — several parents confirmed their children needed one or two attempts. Good academic foundation before applying is advisable, especially for mid-school entry at Class VIII–IX.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="check-num">5</div>
      <div class="check-content"><strong>SAI for international-minded families</strong> Parents at SAI specifically mentioned the IGCSE track as the deciding factor for their choice — several had family plans for children to study abroad for undergraduate degrees, and CAIE familiarity gives a genuine advantage in international university applications.</div>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- ═══════════════════ IMPORTANT NOTES ═══════════════════ -->
  <h2 id="notes">Important Notes Before You Decide</h2>

  <div class="tips-box">
    <h3>📋 Before You Finalise Any School</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Verify directly with the school.</strong> Fees mentioned here are based on parent interviews, school websites, and aggregator platforms as of February 2026. Schools revise fees annually — always get the official 2026-27 fee circular from the admissions office before making a financial commitment.</li>
      <li><strong>Budget 15–25% extra.</strong> Most private schools charge separately for transport, uniforms, books, lab fees, sports and extracurricular activities. The figures above reflect core tuition and school fees only.</li>
      <li><strong>KV admissions timeline.</strong> Check the KVS admissions portal (kvsonlineadmission.kvs.gov.in) for seat availability and the exact admission calendar for 2026-27. Priority categories are strictly enforced — the window opens early in the year and fills fast.</li>
      <li><strong>Sainik School — confirm current fees.</strong> GoI revises Sainik School fees periodically. Contact the school directly for the confirmed 2026-27 fee structure before planning your budget.</li>
      <li><strong>AISSEE for Sainik School.</strong> The All India Sainik Schools Entrance Examination is competitive and has a specific preparation path — start at least 6–8 months before the exam date if your child is interested.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="verdict">
    <div class="v-tag">✅ ValueLayer Bottom Line</div>
    <p>For board results and national rankings: <strong>ODM</strong>. For international curriculum: <strong>SAI International</strong>. For trusted heritage at mid-budget: <strong>DAV Unit-VIII or DAV CSP</strong>. For exceptional value (if eligible): <strong>Kendriya Vidyalaya</strong>. For mid-budget city-wide accessibility: <strong>Mother's Public School</strong>. For residential discipline and military culture: <strong>Sainik School</strong>. The right school depends on your child's learning style, your family's location, and your total budget including hidden costs — not just the brochure number.</p>
